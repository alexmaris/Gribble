Gribble
=============

Gribble is a simple, Linq enabled ORM designed to work with dynamically created tables. Gribble supports POCO's and has a fluent mapping API (shamelessly ripped off from FluentNHibernate). It is not meant to be a replacement for a real ORM like NHiberate but to handle an edge case that NHibernate was not designed for.
